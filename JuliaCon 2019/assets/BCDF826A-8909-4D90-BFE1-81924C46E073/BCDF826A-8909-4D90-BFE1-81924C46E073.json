However, the libraries that we are calling are generally written in other languages and treated as an undebuggable black-box. If you’re interested in adding a hook in R’s deSolve ODE solvers for some new QsP model, or want to dig in and find out why Stan’s Bayesian estimation is missing a peak, you will not find R code. Instead, you will find that the core of these libraries are written in FORTRAN 77\/90 and C++, and investigating what they are doing requires using opaque and non-interactive languages.","targetRectangle":{"y":151.1146165448219,"x":80.884888076735081,"width":895.25200000000018,"height":384.17120361328131}},{"text":"Drug development","targetRectangle":{"y":536.11461654482196,"x":80.884888076735081,"width":244.55520000000001,"height":34.17120361328125}},{"text":"De-risking investment and expedite time to market.
